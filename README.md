# Transit-IQ 🚏🧠

**The Intelligent Brain for Pune's Buses**
A Live Demo of Pune Transit Intelligence powered by Machine Learning and Operations Research.

Transit-IQ is a comprehensive, open-source Intelligent Transit Management System tailored for PMPML (Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd.). It solves the classic commuter problem—"Is my bus 5 minutes away or 45 minutes away?"—by combining predictive passenger demand, dynamic fleet optimization, and real-time mapping into a unified platform.

### 3. Demand Forecasting
Deep-dive into route-specific forecasts within the Operator Dashboard. Features real-time demand curves, 4-hour forward-looking peaks, and integrated historical comparisons such as Weekday vs. Weekend volume profiles to anticipate passenger surges.

### 4. Fleet Optimization
Data-driven fleet deployment interface that allows operators to visualize live bus distribution and apply mathematically optimized strategies. Provides a visual tradeoff analysis between wait scores, fuel costs, and passenger coverage based on live telemetry.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Facebook Prophet Demand Forecasting
Predicts passenger demand per route, per 15-minute slot, up to 4 hours ahead.
- Seamlessly integrates Pune's specific calendar features (e.g., Ganpati festival, IPL matches) into the forecasting model.
- Includes a bespoke **Rain-to-Bus Model** shifting 2-wheeler commuters to buses automatically during rainfall simulations.

### 2. Live Fleet Optimization (OR-Tools)
Utilizes Google OR-Tools to compute the mathematically optimal bus frequency for each route based on live and predicted demand signals.
- Generates actionable deployment recommendations for dispatchers.
- Adjusts fleets dynamically to maximize efficiency and minimize overcrowding.

### 3. Dynamic RAPTOR Route Planning
Provides users with exact minute-precision journey planning.
- Calculates transit routes using a Python implementation of the RAPTOR algorithm.
- Displays realistic upcoming bus departures by automatically simulating frequency intervals and real-time fare calculations.
- Assigns specific mock license plates (`MH-12-xx-xxxx`) so passengers know exactly which physical bus to board.

### 4. Interactive Operator Dashboard
A dedicated, real-time command center for PMPML operators:
- Real-time fleet tracking via Leaflet.js interactive maps.
- Live telemetry including health metrics (CPU/RAM thresholds, active API connections).
- Review pipeline for approving or rejecting OR-Tools generated fleet recommendations.

### 5. Multi-Modal Passenger Application
A modern rider-facing interface optimized for quick look-ups.
- Features dynamic "Step Card" UI directions mimicking premium navigation apps (walking distances, transfers, fare estimates, and crowd density).
- Uses state-of-the-art UI animations driven by `framer-motion` and crisp iconography via `lucide-react`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.9+
* Node.js v18+ & npm
* Git

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayush-Jayatkar/Transit-IQ.git
cd Transit-IQ
```

### 2. Start the Backend Server
The FastAPI server handles the ML inferences and data APIs.
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```
*The backend API Docs (Swagger) will be available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.*

### 3. Start the Frontend Application
In a new terminal window:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will launch at `http://localhost:5173/`.

## 🏆 Conclusion
Transit-IQ successfully bridges the gap between historical static transit routing and dynamic, live-intelligence operations. By utilizing robust machine learning methodologies (Prophet, Isolation Forests) coupled with hardened operations-research constraint processing (OR-Tools), we present a next-generation platform that scales with real-world infrastructure complexity. It transforms City Transit from a reactive entity into a proactive, adaptive, and highly trustworthy network for its citizens.
